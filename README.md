# Hue BLE Desktop

Hue BLE Desktop is a cross-platform desktop application built with **Electron**, **TypeScript**, **React**, and **Webpack**. It allows users to connect and control their Hue lights via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) directly from their desktop.

## Prerequisites

Before you can start using the app, you need to establish a connection with your Hue lights using your phone and make them discoverable. Here's how you can set it up:

### Steps to Connect Your Hue Lights

1. **Set up your Hue lights**:

    - Ensure that your Hue lights are connected to your phone via hue philips app.

2. **Connect the lights with your phone**:

    - Open the **Hue** app on your phone.
    - Ensure that your lights are powered on and available.

3. **Make the lights discoverable**:

    - In the Hue app, tap on the **gear icon** (settings).
    - Navigate to **Voice Assistants** (e.g., Alexa or Google Assistant).
    - Choose any voice assistant and enable the **Make Discoverable** option.  
      (do not click "done" until you complete the next step)

4. **Connect your PC to the lights**:

    - Once your lights are discoverable, you need to connect your PC to the lights via Bluetooth. Go to your operating systemâ€™s Bluetooth settings and pair the PC with the lights.

5. **Start using the app**:
    - After a successful connection, you can now use the **Hue BLE Desktop** app to connect to the lights and control them.
